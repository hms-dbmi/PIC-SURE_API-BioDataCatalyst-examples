# PIC-SURE_API BioData Catalyst examples
Jupyter Notebooks examples of PIC-SURE API use-cases, using BioData Catalyst studies. Run one of the following notebooks to get a quick grasp of python/R PIC-SURE API usage.

## Repo organisation
This repo contains the following files:
- *HPDS_connection.ipynb*: **Start from here if you're using the PIC-SURE API for the first time**. This notebook explain how to get a user specific security token, mandatory to be able to run the other notebooks (python kernel).
- *PheWAS_py.ipynb*: A straightforward python PIC-SURE API use-case, using a PheWAS analysis as an illustration example (Python 3 kernel). Require python 3.6 later.
- *py_PICSURE-API_101_PheWAS_example.ipynb*: A notebook that presents the main functionalities of the python PIC-SURE API, and then performs a simple but detailed PheWAS analysis (Python 3 kernel). Require python 3.6 or later.
- *PheWAS_R.ipynb/PheWAS_R.Rmd*: A straightforward R PIC-SURE API use-case, using a PheWAS analysis as an illustration example (R kernel). Available in Jupyter Notebook and RMarkdown formats. Require R 3.5 or later.

The *python_lib* and *R_lib* folder contains respectively Python and R scripts required to run the example Notebooks.
